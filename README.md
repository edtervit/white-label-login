# white-label-login-example
A small example on white-label-login


Small improvements on the example from loot locker: 

- Simple form validation
- If response has an error, display error to user (e.g email already)
- Removed nickname from account creation as I couldn't figure out how to check for unique name nicely. 
- Nickname prompt on first login (forced)
- Added a logout button
